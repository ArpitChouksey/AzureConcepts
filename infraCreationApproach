CREATE AN INFRA:

Final Version:

üéØ 3-Tier Architecture ‚Äì Interview Explanation Script
‚úÖ Start with the Overall Design Intent
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve designed a secure and scalable 3-tier architecture for microservices which can be deployed either on bare metal (IaaS) or on a managed Kubernetes platform like AKS, depending on the client's needs. Let me walk through both models ‚Äî public-facing and private-facing ‚Äî and then explain how we approach it with AKS.‚Äù

üîπ 1. Bare Metal Infrastructure (IaaS)
üü¢ A. Public-Facing Architecture
Public IP:

We create a static public IP which is attached to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to expose our services externally.

Load Balancer & DNS:

ALB routes traffic to backend pools (VMs).

We register a DNS domain (e.g., via GoDaddy, Azure DNS) and map a CNAME to the ALB‚Äôs DNS name.

VNet & Subnets:

A single VNet with four subnets:

frontend-subnet

backend-subnet

db-subnet

gateway-subnet (for VPN access)

Security Controls:

Use NSGs for traffic control.

Optionally use ASGs to simplify rule targeting across multiple VMs.

Apply custom UDRs and firewall rules if needed.

Bastion Host:

Use Azure Bastion for secure RDP/SSH access to VMs, without exposing any public ports.

NAT Gateway:

Attached to the subnets to allow outbound internet access securely, by hiding the VMs' IPs.

üü† B. Private Infrastructure (Non-Internet)
Private Load Balancer + Private DNS:

Use a Private IP Load Balancer.

Create Azure Private DNS Zone and register internal domains like app.internal.local.

Subnets and VMs:

Same as public ‚Äî frontend, backend, db subnets inside a VNet.

VMs only communicate internally via private IPs or private endpoints.

Access and Patching:

Direct Azure portal access or internal jumpbox (if allowed).

Optionally attach NAT Gateway temporarily for patching only.

No Bastion, No Public IPs:

Strong isolation. Preferred for compliance or highly regulated workloads.

‚ò∏Ô∏è 2. Kubernetes-Based (AKS)
‚ÄúFor microservices, we prefer AKS for better scalability, deployment automation, and service discovery.‚Äù

üß± AKS Cluster Setup
Cluster Creation:

Define Kubernetes version, VM size, region, and Azure CNI for advanced networking.

VNet & Subnets:

We create a VNet with multiple subnets.

Each node pool is assigned a specific subnet (e.g., frontend-pool, backend-pool).

Helps with network-level isolation and fine-grained control.

Node Pools:

Multiple node pools for:

Frontend services

Backend APIs

Stateful services (e.g., DB, Redis)

Ingress & Load Balancing:

Deploy Ingress Controller (NGINX or AGIC).

Exposes services using a LoadBalancer IP (public or private).

IP is mapped to DNS (CNAME/A record) for routing.

RBAC and Security:

Azure AD integration allows AKS RBAC mapped to AAD groups.

Apply network policies, PodSecurityPolicies, and Secrets encryption.

Connectivity:

Use VNet peering, S2S VPN, or ExpressRoute to connect AKS with on-prem or other VNets.

üß© Optional Add-ons and Best Practices
Use Key Vault with pod-managed identities for secret access.

Add Log Analytics + Azure Monitor for observability.

Enable auto-scaling for node pools and HPA/VPA for pods.

Apply network policies to restrict pod-to-pod traffic.

Use Container Registry (ACR) for image storage and integrate with CI/CD pipelines.

‚úÖ Final Talking Point for Interview
‚ÄúWith AKS, we automate deployments, achieve microservice isolation via node pools and namespaces, and enforce security using Azure-native tools. On bare metal, we strictly control ingress/egress traffic, protect VMs with NSG and firewalls, and follow DNS and subnetting best practices to achieve modular, secure, and scalable architectures for both public and private workloads.‚Äù

Custom Defincation:

‚úÖ Designing Secure and Scalable Infrastructure for 3-Tier Microservices Architecture
We can design such infrastructure in multiple ways, primarily classified into:

1) Bare Metal
2) Microservices Architecture (via AKS)
üß± 1) Bare Metal Infrastructure
It can be further classified into two parts:
A) Public (Internet-facing) Infrastructure

B) Private (Non-Internet) Infrastructure

üîπ A) Public Internet-Facing Infrastructure
Here‚Äôs how we can design it:

Public IP

Start by creating a static public IP for the Load Balancer.

Load Balancer

Attach the public IP to the Load Balancer.

For single-region infrastructure, use Application Load Balancer.

For multi-region, consider using Azure Traffic Manager for global routing.

DNS

Create a CNAME record in Azure DNS, and associate it with the Load Balancer‚Äôs domain name.

Make sure the DNS zone is registered with a provider (like GoDaddy, Azure DNS, or AWS Route53), and configure the required NS records.

Networking

Create a VNet, then define four subnets:

Frontend

Backend

Database

Gateway Subnet (used for user access via P2S/S2S VPN)

Network Security

Apply NSGs (Network Security Groups) to control traffic at subnet or NIC level.

Use ASGs (Application Security Groups) for logical grouping and simplified rules.

Configure firewall and route table rules to allow only required IPs or ranges.

Port Security

Allow only essential ports, e.g., 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS).

Avoid exposing management ports (like RDP or SSH) publicly.

NAT Gateway

Use NAT Gateway for secure outbound internet access from VMs.

It masks VM IPs and improves security and scalability.

Bastion

Use Azure Bastion for secure VM access without exposing public IPs or SSH/RDP ports.

üîí This setup is recommended for public-facing workloads where external access is required.

üîπ B) Private (Non-Internet) Infrastructure
Private DNS + Load Balancer

Use a Private DNS Zone.

Create a Private IP Load Balancer and map it to internal DNS entries.

Register records (e.g., A or CNAME) in Azure Private DNS.

Networking

Create a VNet and define similar subnets as public infra (frontend, backend, db, gateway).

No Bastion

Bastion is not typically used here since access is restricted to internal connectivity only (e.g., via Azure portal or jumpbox).

NAT Gateway (Optional)

Use NAT Gateway only for occasional patching or dependency installations.

If security policy restricts internet access, avoid using NAT Gateway entirely.

Private Communication

Ensure internal services communicate via private IPs or use Private Endpoints to securely connect to PaaS services (e.g., Azure SQL, Storage).

üîí This setup is recommended for backend systems, databases, and internal apps that don't require internet exposure.

‚ò∏Ô∏è 2) AKS-Based Microservices Architecture
For a scalable and containerized deployment, you can use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Key Steps:
Cluster Creation

Create an AKS cluster with:

Resource group, region, and Kubernetes version

VM size and number of nodes

Azure CNI networking

Private or public cluster as per requirement

Node Pools

Create multiple node pools (e.g., frontend, backend, db workloads).

Assign node pools to dedicated subnets if needed for network control.

Ingress Controller

Enable Ingress for traffic routing.

Options include:

Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC)

NGINX Ingress Controller

Other third-party ingress controllers

DNS + Load Balancer

The Ingress Controller exposes a service of type LoadBalancer.

The LoadBalancer IP (public or private) is mapped to DNS using A/CNAME record.

Deployment

Deploy microservices into namespaces.

Use Helm or Kustomize for deployment and configuration.

Apply RBAC and network policies to secure internal traffic.

üéØ AKS gives you auto-scaling, monitoring, CI/CD integration, and better workload isolation for modern cloud-native apps.

‚úÖ Final Summary (Interview-Ready Response)
‚ÄúWe design 3-tier microservices infrastructure using either bare-metal or AKS-based approaches. In bare-metal, we manage networking with VNets, NSGs, public or private load balancers, NAT gateways, and DNS mapping. Public-facing setups use Azure Bastion for secure access, while private-facing setups rely on internal DNS and private IPs. In AKS, we deploy microservices into isolated node pools within subnets and use ingress controllers to expose services via load balancers mapped to DNS. This allows us to scale, secure, and manage microservices effectively across frontend, backend, and database tiers.‚Äù

My Defination:


For design secure, scalable infra for 3 tier micro svc can we possible in multiple way:

Let me subdivded it into couples of part:

1) Bare Matel.
2) Microsvc arh.

1) In barematel it can be classified into two part:
A) Public internet facing infra.
B) Private network connectivity.

Let me explain one by one:

1) For Public internet facing we can do below thing:

a) First we can crate public static IP for LB.
b) Attached this ip to LB is we can create single region infra we can go with application lb or for multiple region we can go with traffic manager, for now let consider single tier  and go with application lb.
c) Then create a CName record for Azure DNS and Attached with LB name also it is mandatory you need to register this DNS with DNS provider like goo daddy, azure dns or aws and should create ns.
d) after creating all this component we can create vnet in which we can create 4 subnet
	First is for frontend, then backend, db, and last is gateway subnet for user acccess thorugh p2s or s2s as per needed.
e) after creating subnet we can set up firewall rules, route table rules for certain ip or allow all ips at subnet level we can create NSG and ASG if needed.
f) Make sure the good practice is always allow http/https port and some other port only if needed so that we can create overview of this infra.
g) then for allowing access vm to the internet we can set-up NAT Gw so is used to mask ips and provide more security.
h) also for connecting vms we can go with bastion service and prefer sol. that is the over infra for public subnet facing.

2) For Intra without internet subnet:

a) For pvt facing infra we can use private hostage zone we create private ip attached with application lb and create recorde ser for private dns and attached this lb to azure dns.
b) Then we create vnet inside it we can create subnet like we do for public infra.
c) Here we dindt use bastion service as it need jumpbox we can access vm directly via azure portal.
d) Optionally for patching activity we create NAT GW for installing dependency else dont do it.
e) Every internal service should community with pvt ip or pvt endpoint.

Thats are some basic point to be noted while creating private infra.

3) For AKS Part.

For this deployment we can create AKS Cluster provide AKS cluster details resource name version for k8s upgrade how many node pool needed which arch.is follow and after creating a cluster we can deploy are microservice and enable ingress option on it.

We can use azure ingress class, nginx ingress class or other.

We can mapped infress ip with LB
