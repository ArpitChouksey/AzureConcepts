GoldMens Sach:


Have you intrigrate CI/CD Pipeline, What all the stages.
have you configure sonal qube for diffrent project.
what are metirices you capture in sonar qube.
is that 80% configure hardcoded for all project.
i have less than 80% code coverage so does pipeline got failed?
where did you provide a flag that stage is skip.
their are two project so in one project we need to skip and other project need to allow.
how this docker and k8s are diffrent.
what was the use of ingress and why we dont use LB.
did you ever face to deal with cred. in pipeline, service token or something like that.
one of the pods is not coming up so how you trouble shoot and due to this one pods so does pipeline got fail, how you handel this?
how do youb handle rolback.
you managed infra and what was the endpoint you used here & time here and how you optimized it 40%.
how do you reduce build faliure and reduce 40% of build falire.
how do you reduce deployment by 50%: progress line no. 3rd.
how do you reslove more that 80% alert.
String : "apple" count non repeating words in min. time complex.
What was the production issue are you face in your exp.
when you run ls -lrth cmd inside login in your vm but is their any way without logging you can run the cmd
If some file is missing so how you create some logging or something without logging how you slove this problem.
